Stock prediction

I have always loved trasding even before i actually started trading. 
I have always wondered if i can program something that can sort of predict the direction of a stock.
Recently i came across Recurrent neural networks and it uses when it comes to time series problems. 
i went deeper and learned more about it and  i decided why not apply what i learned and i try to build a predictor.
I am not saying what i am about to build can see in the future. Absolutely not and i dont recommend using this to make money.
For me its just practise and fun.
